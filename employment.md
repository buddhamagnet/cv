### [UNBOUND](http://unbound.co.uk) JUNE 2011 - PRESENT

Freelancing for a UK-based startup created by the QI research team. Unbound provides a crowd-funded publishing platform for
writers, both published and unknown, and has garnered an impressive amount of press over the last few months:

* [TechCrunch](http://techcrunch.com/2011/05/29/unbound-launches-its-kickstarter-byliner-hybrid-for-celebrity-authors/)
* [Mashable](http://mashable.com/2011/06/01/unbound/)
* [Wired](http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2011-05/29/unbound-publishing-platform)
* [Telegraph](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/hay-festival/8543961/Hay-Festival-2011-New-site-Unbound-gives-readers-the-power-of-publishing.html)

I was originally
brought in to assist in refactoring the original codebase but have since jumped in full-time. [Here's my contribution](https://github.com/buddhamagnet/cv/blob/master/unbound.md).

> “Dave has been an absolute pleasure to work with at Unbound, with his ability to see web development not simply from the coding perspective but from the users experience as well. Producing a site that is clear, works elegantly and doesn't fall over when people with 1.5 million Twitter followers tweet it, is a major achievement. Dave is also extremely affable, very easy to work with, highly conscientious and technically excellent. You couldn't ask for more.”

[Justin Pollard](http://www.visualartefact.com), co-founder.

> “Dave produced creative, well structured and stable code for the Unbound site, rewriting and testing large sections of an existing code base to better suit the application's purpose, as well as building features and squashing major bugs. He was on time, on budget and very conscientious. It is great to be able to work with a developer who is not only highly skilled but who thinks things through to the point of user interaction before implementation as well as during the testing process. This allowed his skills as a developer to help augment product creation in a swiftly changing startup environment. He is an exemplary freelance developer and a pleasure to work with.”

Xander Cansell, product owner.

## [BACK TO CV](https://github.com/buddhamagnet/cv/blob/master/README.md)

### [PEAK BI](http://www.peak.bi/) JANUARY 2016 - PRESENT

Hired by the cloud computing consultancy that worked with The Economist on providing AWS services and training to build a data product using [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) on the front end and [Serverless](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and AWS on the back end.

### [WILD EARTH PRODUCTIONS](http://wildearth.productions) OCTOBER 2014 - PRESENT

Designed and built a fully responsive site backed by [Refinery CMS](http://refinerycms.com) for Wild Earth Productions, a new business specialising in remote location support for film, TV and advertising organisations. The brainchild of Jason Ingamells, owner of the [Woodland Ways](http://woodland-ways.co.uk) bushcraft and survival school and [Anders Brogaard](http://www.andersbrogaard.co.uk), globe-trotting commercial photographer. I am technical consultant on the digital side.

### [THE ECONOMIST](http://www.economist.com) JULY 2012 - DECEMBER 2016

Working with an varied and exciting technology stack (PHP for Drupal and Symfony, Ruby for Puppet, Capistrano, Compass/SASS and an internal Rails application), Varnish, git, memcached, you name it.

#### PROJECTS

#### MICROSERVICE ARCHITECTURE - ONGOING

Instrumental in selling Go to the business and in the process of building out a suite of microservices to run in conjunction with an Enterprise Service Bus (Mulesoft). Services in Go are now being written on both sides of the pond.

#### RAILS APPLICATION - ONGOING

Providing support for a Rails application owned by [Digital News Agency](digitalnewsagency.com) (part of the Economist Group), including advising on upgrading from Rails 2.3.8 to 3 and then 3.1, building a robust test harness around the application and supporting ongoing development. Also involved in building a set of tools in Ruby for use by the ops team.

#### AWS MIGRATION - SHIPPED!

Instrumental in assisting in the migration of The Economist stack onto Amazon. Touched all parts of the migration process, from consulting on migrating our services and packing configurations into Salt, adjusting the deployment process to cater for
auto-scaling, normalising HTTP headers across the whole stack through Incapsula, through the Amazon ELBs, Varnish, web servers and applications. 

#### THE JAVASCRIPT CAMPAIGN - ONGOING

Heavily involved in an ongoing project to bring Javascript development at The Economist into the 21st century (toolset involved:
Bower, Grunt, Yeoman, Jasmine, Qunit, Node and Express).

#### GOOGLE PLAY INTEGRATION - SHIPPED!

Sole developer on a project to integrate our subscription and reconciliation services into Google Play, built using a back end composed of Symfony components and exposing a JSON API. Involves working closely with the team of Java developers tasked with working on the Economist Android app.

#### DECOUPLING THE ECONOMIST - IN PROGRESS

In the midst of a vast project the end goal of which is to deliver a service-oriented architecture for The Economist, which is
essentially a monolithic Drupal installation. Work covers all aspects of this mammoth undertaking, from building of initial feature lists
for potential vendors and working closely with all stakeholders to ensure the project is delivered with minimal risk and disruption.

The system is being broken down into several discrete components which can fail without bringing the rest of the system down and
potentially be swapped out for other components if necessary. The in-house built components involve a large range of technologies - a
data store (current options are Postgres, documented-oriented solutions such as Mongodb for certain sets of data), a series of user-facing components (for example
a Manage My Account system which is being built using a range of cutting-edge front end technologies including Yeoman, Jasmine, PhantomJs, Grunt and
Angular) and a set of carefull designed API.

#### CACHING AUTHENTICATED USERS - SHIPPED!

Intrumental (not my words) in delivering a project whose main remitwas to ensure the site can handle the extra load that will be generated by the uptake 
in registrations and subscriptions generated by the new paywall. Heavy stuff, working on one stream to utilise Varnish to allow us
to cache pages for authenticated users in parallel with a second stream to build the system that returns user data via JSON
to correctly populate the dynamic and user-specific subsystems (user navigation, analytics and ads).

Involved close collaboration with sysadmin to ensure the correct architectural decisions were made (and building tools to speed up the process, 
such as this [memcache client](https://github.com/buddhamagnet/memquery) I wrote to make querying the cache for user sessions easier). 

Also assisted in setting up the new deployment process using Puppet and Capistrano.

#### THE ECONOMIST ON MOBILE - SHIPPED!

Worked on the first part of the Economist mobile project - driving the mobile wallpage implementation as well as working on some high
profile mobile entry points (login and registration pages) as well as a larger initiative to start placing more
diverse Economist content behind the paywall. Check out the following URLs on a smartphone:

* [Print edition](http://economist.com/printedition)

#### THE ECONOMIST PAYWALL - SHIPPED!

Completed a project to decouple the Economist paywall from Drupal and help move The Economist towards a service-oriented archiecture. This
project is pure JavaScript (with an admixture of Jquery and Underscore), tested using Jasmine and Phantom. The application also 
utilises local storage to store pre-compiled paywall templates.

#### BITS AND PIECES 

Also assisting with their migration to git (including developer training and working with sysadmin to modify deployment and CI process accordingly). Have also been made
a core committer which essentially makes me a final checkpoint on code going into the Economist codebase.

Have also made a couple of trips to the Tower (where the journalists live) to introduce the graphics and front end team to the joys
of selenium testing.

> “I worked with Dave Goodchild at the Economist. Dave is a fantastic person to work with. Not only does he hold to a high standard of excellence (even if that means spending great amounts of time cleaning up other people's messes), but he brings a charisma and enthusiasm into his work that is just contagious."

Judah Anthony, lead developer, New York office.

> "I had the luck to work with Dave for almost a year. He is one of the hard worker colleagues who helps you first whenever you have a problem. It was surprising sometimes how quickly and precisely he can solve problems. His technical skills are really great - and also as a team member he is able to keep up a good spirit no matter how hard the pressure is. I would love to work with him again in the future."

Peter Arato, Drupal developer.

### [UNBOUND](http://unbound.co.uk) JUNE 2011 - JUNE 2012

Freelancing for a UK-based startup (Rails 3 platform) created by the QI research team. Unbound provides a crowd-funded publishing platform for
writers, both published and unknown, and has garnered an impressive amount of press over the last few months:

* [TechCrunch](http://techcrunch.com/2011/05/29/unbound-launches-its-kickstarter-byliner-hybrid-for-celebrity-authors/)
* [Mashable](http://mashable.com/2011/06/01/unbound/)
* [Wired](http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2011-05/29/unbound-publishing-platform)
* [Telegraph](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/hay-festival/8543961/Hay-Festival-2011-New-site-Unbound-gives-readers-the-power-of-publishing.html)

I was originally
brought in to assist in refactoring the original codebase but soon jumped in full-time. [Here's my contribution](https://github.com/buddhamagnet/cv/blob/master/unbound.md).

> “Dave has been an absolute pleasure to work with at Unbound, with his ability to see web development not simply from the coding perspective but from the users experience as well. Producing a site that is clear, works elegantly and doesn't fall over when people with 1.5 million Twitter followers tweet it, is a major achievement. Dave is also extremely affable, very easy to work with, highly conscientious and technically excellent. You couldn't ask for more.”

[Justin Pollard](http://www.visualartefact.com), co-founder.

> “Dave produced creative, well structured and stable code for the Unbound site, rewriting and testing large sections of an existing code base to better suit the application's purpose, as well as building features and squashing major bugs. He was on time, on budget and very conscientious. It is great to be able to work with a developer who is not only highly skilled but who thinks things through to the point of user interaction before implementation as well as during the testing process. This allowed his skills as a developer to help augment product creation in a swiftly changing startup environment. He is an exemplary freelance developer and a pleasure to work with.”

Xander Cansell, product owner.

### [LOVEFRESH](http://lovefre.sh) AUGUST 2010 - JUNE 2011

Worked as a freelancer for a UK-based startup on the build of a social food application. I pitched in on the Rails side (Rails 2.3.8, subsequently updated to 3), working on features, tests and refactoring. 

> “Dave joined us at a key time in our development of Lovefre.sh, to build out our Ruby on Rails web app prior to launch. He was a pleasure to work with, skilled, had a very positive attitude and a thorough approach.”

Mark Spofforth, CEO.

### [JELLYFISH](http://jellyfish.co.uk) MAY 2007 - SEPTEMBER 2009

Worked as senior developer on a  fast-moving PHP development team comprising 12 developers, three seniors, [one lead](http://blog.mikepearce.net), a DBA, QA tester and manager. I was been involved in a number of projects, starting with converting the existing campaign site templates to standards-compliant tableless design, to playing a large part in rebuilding the entire PHP4 platform from scratch and delivering a PHP5 platform – team used the scrum agile methodology, version control and daily standup meetings to adapt fast to changing requirements. My domain included building a centralized signup process for all campaign sites, re-engineering the fulfillment system and redesigning the product module as a web service. 

> “It was a great pleasure to work with Dave. He is a dedicated and focussed developer as well as being keen to help steer the direction of any product he is working on. He takes ownership of his work and was known for this tenacity in creating good, solid code. Dave is also someone able to talk to clients and colleagues without baffling, scaring or belittling them, something not all developers are capable of. I would definitely work with Dave again.”

Mike Pearce, lead developer.

> “Working alongside Dave at Jellyfish is an experience I will never forget! He is extremely skilled and still manages to fork out time to help guide younger developers when they need explanation / guidance. Dave has a great sense of humour but at the same time works hard when needed to achieve the set goals.”

## [BACK TO CV](https://github.com/buddhamagnet/cv/blob/master/README.md)

### SOME PERSONAL STUFF

#### LANGUAGES

I speak intermediate Spanish and am currently learning French. My Spanish is not fluent yet, but if you dropped me in
a Spanish-speaking country I wouldnâ€™t starve.

### WRITING

I consider myself a writer as well as a programmer. I enter the famous nanowrimo write-a-novel-in-a-month extravaganza every year as a creative exercise.
I completed 2008 with a 50,011 word book.

I am currently writing the first in a sequence of novels. I'm writing the book in [Scrivener](http://literatureandlatte.com). The Scrivener files are in Git
and Scrivener is set up to sync with Dropbox so I can pop up a chapter on the iPad, scribble away, sync and pick it up
on the laptop when I get home. Lose that draft? I don't think so!

### BUSHCRAFT

I have a heavy interest in bushcraft and wilderness survival skills and am enrolled on a two year bushcraft course run by
the wonderful people at [Woodland Ways](http://woodland-ways.co.uk). Connecting with the woods and wilderness gives me balance and perspective and
keeps my eye on what is truly important in life.

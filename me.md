## [BACK TO CV](https://github.com/buddhamagnet/cv/blob/master/README.md) 

### SOME PERSONAL STUFF

#### LANGUAGES

I speak intermediate spanish and am currently learning french. My spanish is not fluent yet, but if you dropped me in<br />
a spanish-speaking countru I wouldnâ€™t starve. 

### WRITING 

I consider myself a writer as well as a programmer. I enter the famous nanowrimo write-a-novel-in-a-month extravaganza every year as a creative exercise - I completed 2008 with a 50,011 word book. I sometimes refer to myself as a word engineer. I also shoot the occasional
video - here's my [vimeo stream](https://vimeo.com/user334655/videos). Be aware I do not behave like this at work.

I am currently writing the first in a sequence of novels. I'm writing the book in [scrivener](http://literatureandlatte.com). The scrivener files are in git
and scrivener is set up to sync with dropbox so I can pop up a chapter on the ipad, scribble away, sync and pick it up
on the laptop when I get home. Lose that draft? I don't think so!

### BUSHCRAFT 
I have a heavy interest in bushcraft and wilderness survival skills and am enrolled on a two year bushcraft course run by
the wonderful people at [woodland ways](http://woodland-ways.co.uk).

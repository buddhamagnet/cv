## IN A NUTSHELL

I am a developer and writer with over a decade of experience working for all
manner of organisations, from working as a single freelancer, through a number
of cool startups, to large companies including [Sun Microsystems](http://sun.com)
and [The Economist](http://economist.com). I am a passionate contributor to
open source (recent contributions include [rstat.us](https://github.com/hotsh/rstat.us) and
[diaspora](https://github.com/diaspora/diaspora)) and was one of the original creators
of [rubyinthepub](http://www.joannageary.com/2010/05/13/ruby-in-the-pub-3/), a meet-up
designed to put developers, journalists and writers in the same room to explore their
common space and collaborate on projects. This small event has since transformed into 
the UK arm of [Hackshackers](http://meetuplondon.hackshackers.com/), an event originally
kicked off by the New York Times.

## EMPLOYMENT

### [UNBOUND](http://unbound.co.uk) JANUARY 2012 - PRESENT

Freelancing for a UK-based startup created by the QI research team. Unbound provides a crowd-funded publishing platform for
writers, both published and unknown, and has garnered an impressive amount of press over the last few months. I was originally
brought in to assist in refactoring the original codebase but have since jumped in full-time. [Here's my contribution](https://github.com/buddhamagnet/cv/blob/master/unbound.md).

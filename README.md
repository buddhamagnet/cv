## IN A NUTSHELL

I am a developer and writer with over a decade of experience working for all
manner of organisations, from working as a single freelancer, through a number
of cool startups, to large companies including [Sun Microsystems](http://sun.com)
and [The Economist](http://economist.com). I am a passionate contributor to
open source (recent contributions include [rstat.us](https://github.com/hotsh/rstat.us) and
[diaspora](https://github.com/diaspora/diaspora)) and was one of the original creators
of [rubyinthepub](http://www.joannageary.com/2010/05/13/ruby-in-the-pub-3/), a meet-up
designed to put developers, journalists and writers in the same room to explore their
common space and collaborate on projects. This small event has since transformed into 
the UK arm of [Hackshackers](http://meetuplondon.hackshackers.com/), an event originally
kicked off by the New York Times.

# DAVID GOODCHILD

## IN A NUTSHELL

I am a developer and writer with over a decade of experience working for all
manner of organisations, from working as a single freelancer, through a number
of cool startups, to large companies including [Sun Microsystems](http://sun.com)
and [The Economist](http://economist.com).

Right now I am neck deep in some exciting projects at The Economist building out a microservice architecture in Go. Current
works in progress include an integration service with Apple News, a cross reference service for exchanging canonical IDs relating to resources used by multiple services, integration with [Consul](https://www.consul.io) for service discovery, and work on a content service to decouple data sources from front ends (alongside some devs from [ThoughtWorks](http://www.thoughtworks.com)).We are also looking at some of the components provided
by [go-kit](https://github.com/go-kit/kit).

Some of the code (complete and in progress) from the above has been open sourced:

* [tripper - circuitbreaker wrapper](https://github.com/buddhamagnet/tripper)
* [gq - worker queue package in go](https://github.com/buddhamagnet/gq)
* [goberry - microservice template](https://github.com/EconomistDigitalSolutions/goberry)
* [ramlapi - API plumbing driven by RAML](https://github.com/EconomistDigitalSolutions/ramlapi)
* [watchman - logging and metrics](https://github.com/EconomistDigitalSolutions/watchman)
* [goconsul - simple service registration](https://github.com/buddhamagnet/goconsul)

## COMMUNITY

I was one of the original creators of [rubyinthepub](http://www.joannageary.com/2010/05/13/ruby-in-the-pub-3/), a meet-up
designed to put developers, journalists and writers in the same room to explore their
common space and collaborate on projects. This small event has since transformed into
the UK arm of [Hackshackers](http://meetuplondon.hackshackers.com/), an event originally
kicked off by the New York Times.

Current/recent projects:

* [gothimbl - go client for the thimbl network](https://github.com/buddhamagnet/gothimbl)
* [badaboom - rails export tool for extracting audio from audioboom](https://github.com/buddhamagnet/badaboom)
* [wildearth - refinery site for a remote production support company](https://github.com/buddhamagnet/wildearth)
* [cardshark - rails app built in 40 minutes as a technical test](https://github.com/buddhamagnet/cardshark)

## COMMUNICATION

I pride myself on clear, engaging and timely communication and have delivered training for developers, the latest
example being the handling of transitioning the Economist developer teams from the bzr version control system to git.

## LANGUAGES AND FRAMEWORKS

I pick up and apply new languages and frameworks fast, always keeping an eye on the bleeding edge, balanced with an
understanding of the volatile and transient nature of many of the new and shiny toys. I make heavy use of Ruby and Rails (to which
I have contributed), as well as many of the tools in that ecosystem, and have wide experience with PHP (Drupal and Symfony components). I have also built some internal tools in Go (cache purge tool, some AWS client programs, a configuration API) and started porting some of the Economist API endpoints to this great language.

## HTTP AND THE WEB

My work at The Economist has involved a wholesale refactoring of the caching architecture at the HTTP level ([Varnish](https://www.varnish-cache.org/)) making me extremely familiar with the architecture of the web and its foibles.

## UNIX AND THE COMMAND LINE

Maybe goes without saying, but it's amazing how many developers I run into who are limited in this area. I constantly refine and rework my [dotfiles](https://github.com/buddhamagnet/dotfiles) giving me a portable command line environment wherever I go, and I use a scripted tmux setup to boost productivty. I grew up on Solaris and am comfortable with a wide range of Linux variants (currently CentOS).

## DATABASES

I reach beyond ORMs (Active Record, Doctrine et al) to squeeze as much power and efficiency from the databases that back many of the applications I use and build and am not afraid of SQL. I also have some experience with the NoSQL breed and am dipping into Postgres.

## MODERN JAVASCRIPT AND CSS

After absorbing the contents of JavaScript The Good Parts, I championed the adoption of modern JavaScript libraries and techniques at The Economist, including use of NPM and Node and collaborating with the front end team on building a series of [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) generators. I also assisted
with the in-house implementation of Compass and SASS.

### API DESIGN

I developed (so far) two APIs almost single-handedly at The Economist which deliver JSON output to a variety of consumers (Android for the Google Play API and internal for a subscription access control service), paying special attention to proper use of HTTP verbs and hypermedia design.

### SERVICE ORIENTED ARCHITECTURE

I was instrumental in starting the process of breaking out core application functionality (paywall, access control) into discrete services allowing
rapid iteration and deployment decoupled from the main site.

## DEVOPS

The above initiative was progressed in close collaboration with our sysadmins, something I had never experienced before! I also worked closely with my coleagues to adopt, implement and document the new tools and technologies we used to automate and streamline our workflow ([Varnish](https://www.varnish-cache.org/), [Puppet](http://puppetlabs.com/puppet/puppet-enterprise) and [Salt](http://www.saltstack.com/) and Jenkins).
